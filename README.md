- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LiramuIorin, AKA Mohammed Al Khelaifi, but I prefer Liramu Iorin.
- 
- ðŸ‘€ I am a game programmer, comfortable with Gameplay Programming and AI Programming.
- 
- ðŸŒ± I have done some work in the past, including a completed UE4 project on itch.io, which you can access from my LinkedIn, and an in-progress Unity project.
- 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via LinkedIn, or Twitter. I'm always happy just to hear a pleasant hello, and a wish for a good day!
